                <div>
                    <p>The most important bus for people living in Shobnall should use would be the Midlands Classic Number 10 which has a stop along Shobnall Road, next to the Acorn Inn. And is also right next to the Shobnall Leisure Complex.</p>

                    <p>The other main buses would be Midlands Classic number 3 and 8 which go through Shobnall on the way to the Hospital. You could also take the 401, after getting into town, if you wanted to get into Tutbury or Uttoxeter. This also applies to the 402. To look more into these routes, visit the Midlands Classic website.</p>

                    <p>In terms of Train services, there is only really one option to take, which is the Burton Railway Station. Which can take you to Willington, Tamworth, and Long Eaton, to name a few smaller areas. You can also get to the Cities: Derby, Nottingham and Birmingham, Leeds, York, and Newcastle.</p>

                <h3>Cycle Path</h3>

                <p>In the case of cycle paths, your most local area to do a bike ride would be the Kingfisher Trail which is located near the Shobnall Leisure complex and ends up next to Eton Park School.</p>
                <p>The Trail is 2 KM long and was made due to a community project when members of the community saw that the area was being used for Fly-tipping (dumping rubbish) and was covered in graffiti and decided to Make it into something positive that the whole community could use.</p>
                <p>The Trail is also a nature reserve and is very well kept making sure that the place isn't an eyesore again and to ensure that nothing messes with animalâ€™s habitats.</p>
                <p>There is also the Millennium cycle route which branches off from the Kingfisher trail in several places, as shown on the image to the right.</p>
