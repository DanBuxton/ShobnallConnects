				<h3>The Kingfisher trail</h3>

				<p>The Kingfisher trail is a path that follows the canals down towards Stretton. The path came about because the area was not very well kept before and so the community decided to take the place that had initially been used for fly-tipping (dumping rubbish) and was covered in graffiti and make it into a nature reserve and a public footpath.</p>
